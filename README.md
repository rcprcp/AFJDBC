# AFJDBC - Arrow Flight JDBC Test 

This program is a very simple test for the Arrow JDBC driver. Remember to update the pom.xml for the particular version of the driver that you want.

Build via the usual:
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/rcprcp/AFJDBC.git
cd AFJDBC
mvn clean package
```
Then run it: 
```Shell
java -jar target/AFJDBC-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
(remember to hit return after you start the program.)
